/**
 * Implements the `HashRouter` to navigate between pages without requesting them to the server.
 * In a hash router, the location is kept in the hash portion or the URL:
 *
 * ```
 * https: // example.com : 8080 /something/ ?query=abc123 #/fooBarBaz
 *
 * ⎣____⎦    ⎣__________⎦  ⎣__⎦ ⎣________⎦ ⎣____________⎦ ⎣________⎦
 * protocol     domain     port    path      parameters      hash
 * ```
 *
 * The router is initialized with a list of routes, each with a path and a component.
 * Routes can contain parameters, which are extracted from the path and made available.
 * Parameters are defined in the path with a colon, like `/user/:id`.
 * A catch-all route can be defined with a path of `*`.
 *
 * The router starts listening to the browser's popstate events when initialized.
 * To initialize the router, call the `init()` method.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const routes = [
 *  { path: '/', component: Home },
 *  { path: '/one', component: One },
 *  { path: '/two/:userId/page/:pageId', component: Two },
 *  { path: '*', component: NotFound },
 * ]
 *
 * const router = new HashRouter(routes)
 * router.init()
 * ```
 *
 * ## Routes
 *
 * A route is an object with the following properties:
 *
 * - `path` (`string`): The path of the route.
 * - `component` (`Component`): The component to render when the route is matched. Use the '*' path to match any route.
 * - `redirect?` (`string`): The path to redirect to when the route is matched.
 * - `beforeEnter?` (`(from: string, to: string) => Promise<boolean|string>`): The function to call before the navigation, and which can be used to cancel the navigation or redirect to another route.
 *
 * A simple route has a `path` and a `component`:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * { path: '/users', component: Users }
 * ```
 *
 * This route matches the `/users` path and renders the `Users` component.
 * The path can include parameters by prefixing the parameter name with a colon ('`:`').
 * These parameters are extracted from the path and made available in the `params`
 * property of the router:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * { path: '/users/:userId', component: User }
 * ```
 *
 * This route matches the `/users/123` path and renders the `User` component.
 * The `params` property of the router will contain `{ userId: '123' }`.
 *
 * Routes can define a redirect path:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * { path: '/old-users', redirect: '/users' }
 * ```
 *
 * This route matches the `/old-users` path and redirects to the `/users` path.
 *
 * Routes can define a guard function that is called before the navigation, and decides
 * whether the navigation should be allowed or not:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * { path: '/users', component: Users, beforeEnter: (from, to) => Promise<boolean|string> }
 * ```
 *
 * The guard function receives the path of the source route and the target route.
 * If it returns `false`, the navigation is canceled.
 * If it returns a string, the navigation is redirected to the returned path.
 * If it returns `true` or nothing, the navigation is allowed.
